# 👋 Hi, I'm Paras

**17 y/o self-taught developer | Indie hacker | Work in progress**

### 🧠 Who I Am
I failed the traditional system — not because I couldn’t learn, but because I refused to learn the wrong way.  
Now I’m building my own path with code, curiosity, and conviction.

---

### 🛠️ What I'm Building
**🔇 [SilentGoals.app](https://silentgoals.app)** — a minimalist goal tracker for people who’d rather *do the work* than talk about it.

> Quietly ambitious. Purposefully focused.  
> Built for those who move in silence.

### 💡 Currently Exploring
- **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- Scalable backend architecture
- Clean, distraction-free UI/UX
- Mental health–friendly tech

---

### ✅ Previously Worked With
- **PEN Stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js)
- Basic frontend stacks (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Git + GitHub for version control

---

### 🧘‍♂️ Philosophy
> “Failing the system doesn't make you a failure.  
> It makes you free to build something better.”
